# Securing the Self-Healing Stack: AI-Augmented Automation for Cyber Defense

- Objective: Rehearse using bullet points, focus more on casual conversation style rehearsal

## Beginning (Hook & Framing)

- Hook:  
  “What if your security stack could detect a threat and fix it before you even knew something was wrong?”  
  OR  
  “You can’t hire enough people to watch every alert—but what if your tools could watch themselves?”

- Why this matters:  
  - Breaches happen fast; response needs to be faster.  
  - AI/ML and automation can shift security from *reactive* to *self-healing*.

- Roadmap:  
  “Today, I’ll cover how AI/ML is used in anomaly detection, how to design auto-remediation playbooks, and some real-world tools I’ve explored in my lab.”

## Middle (Core Content)

### a. How AI/ML is used in anomaly detection:

- Tools like **EDR (CrowdStrike), NDR, UEBA** detect abnormal behavior using models.  
- Examples:
  - Detecting a process injecting into another on an endpoint (EDR).
  - Detecting unusual lateral movement across VLANs (NDR).
  - Flagging a user logging in at 3 AM from an unusual location (UEBA).

- Benefits:
  - Scales detection.
  - Finds subtle patterns humans may miss.

### b. Designing playbooks for auto-remediation:

- What is a playbook?  
  A step-by-step automated response to alerts.
  
- Examples:
  - Quarantining a suspicious endpoint.  
  - Rotating secrets automatically if suspicious access is detected.  
  - Blocking an IP on the firewall automatically if flagged by NDR.

- Benefits:
  - Speed.
  - Consistency.
  - Reduced analyst fatigue.

### c. Risks of false positives vs. action thresholds:

- Key challenge: Acting too aggressively can block legitimate activity.  
- Importance of:
  - Tiered thresholds (alert-only → partial containment → full containment).  
  - Human-in-the-loop for high-impact actions until confidence is high.  
  - Continuous tuning of detection models and playbooks.

### d. Real-world tooling:

- **Cortex XSOAR:** Building and testing automated workflows.  
- **CrowdStrike:** Using detection + containment capabilities.  
- **Python + LLM wrappers:** Automating investigation, generating remediation scripts, summarizing alerts for analyst review.

## End (Summary & Call to Action)

- Recap:  
  “We covered how AI/ML detection, automated playbooks, and smart thresholds create a self-healing security stack.”

- Takeaway:  
  Automation is not about replacing humans but about letting them focus on decisions that matter while your stack handles the noise.

- Call to Action:  
  “If you’re building your lab, try automating a single repetitive task. Experiment with a small playbook in XSOAR or a Python script that rotates secrets. You’ll see how quickly your stack can start healing itself.”

- Closing:  
  “The attackers are automating. So should we.”
