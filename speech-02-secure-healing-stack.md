**Title:** Practical Detection and Automated Response for Incident Containment

**Objective:** Clear, technical rehearsal points for practitioner delivery.

### Beginning (Direct Framing)

* "We can't watch every alert, but we can set up detection and automated containment to handle the noise."
* "Breaches move fast; we need a way to respond faster without adding unnecessary manual steps."
* "Today, I’ll walk through how to use detection rules, automated response playbooks, and practical tools to reduce repetitive manual work."

### Middle (Technical Content)

#### 1. Detection methods:

* Use EDR, NDR, and SIEM tools for rule-based, baseline, and correlation-based detection.

**Examples:**

* Detect process injection on endpoints.
* Spot unusual VLAN lateral movement.
* Flag off-hours logins from unexpected locations.

#### 2. Building automated response playbooks:

* Define clear, step-by-step automated responses tied to detection triggers.

**Examples:**

* Quarantine endpoints.
* Rotate secrets when suspicious access is found.
* Block flagged IP addresses automatically.

#### 3. Managing false positives and thresholds:

* Avoid over-blocking legitimate activity.
* Use tiered actions: alert → partial containment → full containment.
* Keep high-impact actions gated by human review until confidence in detections is established.
* Regularly tune detection rules and response playbooks.

#### 4. Tools for implementation:

* Use Cortex XSOAR for workflow automation.
* Use CrowdStrike detection and containment.
* Write Python scripts for secret rotation, account disabling, and endpoint isolation.
* Use Sysmon + Sigma rules for custom detection tuning.

### End (Direct Wrap-Up)

* "Today we covered practical detection, automated response playbooks, and handling false positives."
* "Automation and response workflows help us keep up with incidents without burning out on repetitive tasks."
* "If you're testing this, start by automating one repetitive response task in your lab to see where it saves time and improves consistency."
