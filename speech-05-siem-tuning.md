## ROUGH DRAFT - Beyond Alerts: Building Autonomous Detection & Response with Logs, Code, and Context

Key Angles:
- SIEM tuning: MITRE tags, Sigma rules, custom parsers
- Using Git workflows and CI/CD to maintain detection-as-code
- Enriching detections with threat intel, process tree correlation
- Automating the boring: Slack alerts, JIRA tickets, or blocking via API
