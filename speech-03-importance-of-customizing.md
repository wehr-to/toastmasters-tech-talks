# Speech Outline: The Importance of Customizing Your Own Software

## Intro: Set the Stage

- **Hook**: The difference between being a consumer of tools versus a creator of workflows.  
- **Theme**: Out-of-the-box software vs tailored, self-designed environments.  
- **Examples to ground it**:  
  - Chrome vs Firefox (locked ecosystem vs open customization)  
  - Windows vs Linux (one-size-fits-all vs infinite variations)  
  - Vim (a “blank slate” editor that only becomes powerful when you shape it)  
  - Typst vs Google Docs (lightweight, scriptable control vs bloated, one-size-fits-all editor)
  
## Middle: Why Customization Matters

### Creativity and Innovation
- Blindly using defaults locks you into someone else’s assumptions.  
- Customization fosters problem-solving and design thinking.  

### Ergonomics and Efficiency
- Custom keybindings, browser profiles, or stripped-down distros save time.  
- Example: mapping keystrokes in Vim to reduce repetitive strain.  
- Typst’s text-first approach makes structured writing faster and more reproducible than a click-heavy UI.  

### Security and Control
- Hardened browser configs (vs stock Chrome) protect privacy.  
- Minimalist Linux installs reduce attack surface.  
- Owning your documents in Typst means independence from cloud lock-in.  

### Sense of Ownership
- Your system feels like *yours*, not borrowed.  
- Builds confidence and mastery of the tools you rely on.  

### Philosophy of Technologists
- Real technologists see software as clay, not marble.  
- “Defaults” are just starting points, not prisons.  
- Mastery comes from straying beyond what is handed to you.  

### Historical / Cultural Parallel (optional)
- Tinkerers, hackers, and innovators often started by modifying what already existed.  
- Progress in technology has always been fueled by customization.  

## Conclusion: Bring It Together

- **Warning**: Using only packaged defaults breeds complacency.  
- **Encouragement**: Configuring tools forces critical thinking and problem ownership.  
- **Vision**: Technology becomes limitless when you bend it to your needs.  
- **Closing line idea**: The difference between a user and a technologist is the willingness to own your workflow.  

## Demos
### 1. Browser Security & Customization
- Default: Open Chrome with the default homepage and settings.
- Customized: Open hardened Firefox profile showing:
- Privacy-focused extensions (uBlock, NoScript, Multi-Account Containers).
- Minimalist toolbar or custom search setup.
- Takeaway: “One is off-the-shelf, the other is shaped to my security and workflow.”

### 2. Basic ergonomics
- showcase keyboard without legends and show how i type faster when i train myself to memorize where keys are
- vim and show mapped keys, show myself moving 3 lines with a single keystroke in vscode
- defaults require repetition and thought, customizaiton really compresses effort

### 3. Writing Workflow (Typst vs Google Docs)
- Default: Open Google Docs, add a simple heading and bullet list by clicking menus.
- Customized: In Typst, type a short snippet that instantly renders into structured, styled text.
- Takeaway: “Clicking vs scripting, speed and reproducibility come from owning the structure.”

### 4. System Ownership (Linux vs Windows)
- Default: Show a cluttered Windows taskbar/start menu with preinstalled apps.
- Customized: Switch to your stripped-down Linux terminal with only the essentials running.
- Takeaway: “When you strip down to what you actually need, you cut noise and attack surface.”

### 5. Philosophical Visual (Optional Closer)
- Display a config file (like .vimrc or .typst template) next to a marketing screenshot of Chrome/Windows/Docs.
- Briefly point out: “This looks like code, but it's really just means to ownership of your own workflow"
