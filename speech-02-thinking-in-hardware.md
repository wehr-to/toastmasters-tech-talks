## Intro bullet points 

- A lot of things in life can be attributed to cause and effect
- You flip a light switch, and the room lights up. But what really happened?
- The switch closed a circuit, allowed current to flow, which excited atoms in a filament or triggered LEDs to emit photons.
You didnâ€™t see all that. You just saw the effect.
- We treat software the same way, we click, it responds, not many question the cause and beneath below these actions, and especially what would happen if someone were to break the cause and effect chain.
- I will explain that to truly build, defend, or understand technology, you need to think in layers down to hardware, firmware, and physical memory itself

The goal of this section was to really get the audience picturing how to envision the rest of the talking points 

## Mid section / Abstractions are the illusion

- Many live in the effect only while never seeing the true cause, think someone only operating within a GUI and never thinking to see the syscall or write code while never wondering what exactly the CPU does with it
- While operating systems, libraries, and drivers exist to hide complexity and make things easier, they can make a defender blind to vulnerabilities beneath, and this can allow an attacker to not only control the cause but the effect as well
- A prime example of this is spectre, they didnt break into the OS, but rather exploited the way CPU's guess the future and leaked data from processes
- Tying back to my point, these high level attacks do not care about what you wrote, they care about what your actual machine guesses, stores, and moves information at the lowest level

## Wrapup 

- We patch web apps, we scan ports, but asking yourself how does the memory actually behave is equally if not more important
- The book OSTEP teaches that the OS exists to manage complexity and isolation, things like memory management, scheduling, and syscalls, but if the OS is built on assumptions on how the hardware behaves, and the hardware gets manipulated, then even your OS becomes exploitable.
- To tie everything back to the beginning point, as a security professional has to think beyond "how does this python function work" but rather "how does this syscall behave?", in laymans terms understanding the underlying causes has more secure outcomes.
