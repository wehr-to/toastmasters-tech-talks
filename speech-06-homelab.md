- The purpose it solves, is in the name itself, a lab in your home to test and run various different tools to enhance your networks security, automation, the list goes on

- it is no different than being a mechanic who says they don't mess with cars in their free time, I wouldn't trust someone who doesn't do this in their free time
- teaches you core job skills and you can essentially build out any type skill stack you want, from devops to network security, you can do it all without waiting for permission from your current employer
-

- opens a users eyes to basic digital hygiene and you'll learn something new
- makes you more technically competent in an era where the bar for basic technical literacy is rising by the year

- allows you to take ownership of your own tech stack and forms a symbiotic relationship, with a hobby that directly correlates to professional competency
