Speech overview: 

# Part 1 / The intro 

Started speech off with asking the audience as the hook, "who here uses AI now in their day to day jobs or lives? could be for anything" 

Once engagement was received I proceeded to reference how AI is a hot buzzword and topic in modern professional circles. 

I showed an example of how I believe humans and machines will integrate and collaborate, through programming or "vibe coding" 

# Part 2 / what is vibe coding? 

I broke down vibe coding and gave the following analogies: "Traditional programming is like giving a GPS step-by-step directions: Turn right. Now go 2 miles. Exit left.”

Vibe coding, on the other hand, is like saying:
“Take me somewhere with sunshine, a beach, and amazing tacos.”
 And somehow—the car gets you there.
 
With vibe coding, you don’t write every line of code. You describe the vibe of what you want—a mood, a function, a feeling—and the AI figures out how to build it.
Imagine saying:
 “I want a website that feels cozy and vintage, maybe with soft browns and cursive fonts, for my online candle shop.”
And the AI gives you a fully functional design, with the buttons, layout, and even sample text—based on your vibe.

# Part 3 / The changes to web development 

I broke down traditional web development, and what it would take to build something: 
1: A designer to sketch it out 
2: A front-end developer to code the look and what the user sees
3: A back-end developer to handle how exactly it works 

and explained how there is a *lot* of back and forth for days and even weeks. 

I explain with vibe coding, the shift is headed to being a curator of code rather than a builder, with AI it is becoming increasingly common, for better or worse to scaffold code by simply describing what exactly it is you want, and mentioned how the barrier to entry is falling at a rapid rate and how "non-technical" people now have access to code that is functional on a surface level. 

# Part 4 / Security and the curating aspect 

This is where I followed up on part 3 of the speech, and really dove into how something may look great on the surface level, and this is where non-technical people quickly run into trouble as they assume an out the box app produced by AI is functional because an AI simply write it, this is not the case. The apps AI puts out may work on paper, but it's really a matter of *how* many vulnerabilities and exploits are on these applications produced by AI, people specifify what to make, but at the cost of builing it in a secure and iron-clad way in favor of the speed it took to build, and no one really understand *what* the AI actually did. 

I pivoted to explaining how this will shape the future landscape of how developers think and act in the enterprise space, and how new roles will likely emerge in the form of, or new key responsibilities will be emphasized in dev work such as: 
- Prompt security testesrs: people who test how secure-AI generated results are
- AI behavior auditors: think quality control, but for bots
- Code explainers: people who interpret what the AI actually made for non-technical stakeholders

This wont diminish the technical field in the way people spreading fear and uncertainty do, I just believe the field will evolve, just as Excel didnt replace finance jobs and served as a very helpful tool. 

# Part 5 / What this means for developers and security professionals and a recap of my speech: 

I believe learning the fundamentals of programming will never go away and will only be more important as time geos on, along with security education becoming more emphasized as well. 

Not only will you need to understand syntaxes and architectures, but also guiding what AI scaffolds and puts out, and more and more job descriptions will require the following: 
- Reviewing AI generated code
- Securing prompt driven logic
- Auditing systems where devs themselves may not fully understanding what was scaffolded

This is not about losing control as technical professionals, its moving up the stack and emphasizing just how the more important judgement, oversight, and technical depth will matter even more.
